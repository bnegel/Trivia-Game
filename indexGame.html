<!--Please look at the js file called game.js. It's the one I restarted with my tutor
just a few hours before class started and which I WILL finish. Since I now have the page
changing dynamically, I will incorporate the index.html into this page so it actually 
looks like something. And add a timer (which I know was the whole point), and y'know, scores and stuff.-->

<!--Figure out how to change HTML to show questions on click (Javascript onclick function (W3Schools link)-->
<!--Create a second HTML page and use assign() in JS to basically relocate to the new HTML page?-->

<!--Time Remaining area-->

<!--Each question is a row with a row beneath divided into columns for each answer-->
<!--Figure out how (with Bootstrap?) to create responsive answer click circles-->

<!--DONE button goes to Scores page-->

<!--On timesUp, change screen again to show scores: Correct, Incorrect, Unanswered-->

<!--IF TIME: Try to create Reload button so player doesn't have to click the toolbar.-->
